      <h1>Zeke Gabrielse</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Zeke</strong> is an experienced full-stack developer that is currently <strong>for-hire</strong>, and actively looking for a full-time product-based remote position. You can reach out to him directly via <a href="mailto:ezekg@yahoo.com">email</a> or <a href="tel:9407271265">phone</a></li> with job inquiries.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        At this time Zeke is <strong>only</strong> interested in remote work--though if you have an offer in mind that you think is <em>too good to pass up</em>, feel free to reach out!

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Aside from his open-source projects such as <a href="https://github.com/ezekg/xo"><code>xo</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/ezekg/tj"><code>tj</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/ezekg/git-hound"><code>git-hound</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ezekg/swa-dashboard"><code>swa</code></a>, you can find <strong>Zeke</strong>'s favorite adventures below.
      </p>
      <h3>Keygen</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Zeke</strong> founded <a href="https://keygen.sh">Keygen</a> in October 2016 after having seen first-hand that <a href="https://hackernoon.com/finding-issues-and-guessing-solutions-43e6b7ed823e">the current state of software licensing sucks</a>. Instead of being content with the suck, he built a <em>dead-simple software licensing REST API for developers.</em> Keygen is built on top of technologies like Rails, PostgreSQL, Sidekiq and Ember.
      </p>
      <h3>Theme Juice</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Zeke</strong> co-founded <a href="https://www.themejuice.it">Theme Juice</a> in November 2015, which he worked on until early 2017 when he decided to focus his time on other projects. Theme Juice is a Mac app that can spin up a local WordPress development environment at the click of a button. The app is built with tech such as Electron, Vagrant and React.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Before teaching himself to code, <strong>Zeke</strong> started his professional career as a <a href="https://dribbble.com/ezekielg">graphic designer</a>. However, once he quickly picked up frontend development--<em>he was hooked</em>. From there he rapidly began to delve deeper and deeper into the field of computer science and grow his skills as a developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays you can find him enjoying the solitude of <em>backend development</em>, though he is proficient throughout the entire web stack and is highly interested in technologies like React.
      </p>
      <h3>Produce Results (11/2013 - 05/2017)</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Zeke</strong> lead a small development team, handling all-things-web throughout the company. He built and maintained web apps built on Ruby/Rails, PHP, Node, as well as working on countless WordPress and Magento websites.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Before transitioning into development, <strong>Zeke</strong> had been running his own freelance graphic design business for several years.
